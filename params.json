{"name":"Ng-gulp","tagline":"This is a demo project to learn Angular and Gulp","body":"ng-gulp\r\n============\r\n\r\n#Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a project started as a scrachpad applicaiton to start wetting my hands on Angular JS and with my intrest growing day by day on this I felt like there is more to do and started deploying my application in the Cloud platform for me to playaround.\r\n\r\nThe running version can be found at, [http://demo-venkatvp.rhcloud.com](http://demo-venkatvp.rhcloud.com)\r\n\r\n##Demos\r\n\r\n1. TODO: This is a sampe application to mke use of browser's `localstorage` and maintain some persistant data.\r\n2. Temperature Conversion Utility: This is a module dedicated to demo RESTful service Angular JS fusion.\r\n3. Customer : This is a module that makes use of RESTFul webservice and demonstrate the CRUD opration using RESTful services.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to fork and suggest improvements.\r\n\r\n## Onetime Setup\r\nIf you dont have `gulp` and `bower` installed globally before please do this.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g gulp bower \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is required to be done if the `package.json` is updated antime.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nTo start developing in the project run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngulp serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen head to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.\r\n\r\nThe `serve` tasks starts a static file server, which serves the AngularJS application, and a watch task which watches all files for changes and lints, builds and injects them into the index.html accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nTo run tests run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngulp test\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Or** first inject all test files into `karma.conf.js` with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngulp karma-conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you're able to run Karma directly. Example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nkarma start --single-run\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Production ready build - a.k.a. dist\r\n\r\nTo make the app ready for deploy to production run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngulp dist\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow there's a `./dist` folder with all scripts and stylesheets concatenated and minified, also third party libraries installed with bower will be concatenated and minified into `vendors.min.js` and `vendors.min.css` respectively.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-60801328-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
